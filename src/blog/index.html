				<h2>Developing a Private Server</h2>
				<p>
					About a couple of months ago, I started developing a private server for a popular game. While I had some excellent progress making a server from scratch, I ended up getting a private investigator at my doorstep, which handed me over a cease and desist letter. It was at this moment I knew, I fucked up.	
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite all the hard work I put into the project, it would never be able to see the daylight, or at least not without facing a lawsuit. But instead of throwing all my work in the garbage, I have decided to fork the core components of my project and have them re-used in my new private server project, AnimeShooter!
				</p>
				<h3>What is AnimeShooter?</h3>
				<p>
					Before I tell you what AnimeShooter is, let me tell you what MangaFigher is. MangaFigher *was* a Korean multiplayer online third-person shooter game developed by 'OnNet' and hosted by 'GamesCampus'. There was also another variant called 'Qpang' which was hosted by 'Realfogs', Qpang was most popular in The Netherlands and was later on translated to English and German.
				</p>	
				<p>
					With that said, AnimeShooter is a private server based on the Qpang game client. The original games MangaFighter and Qpang have died in 2010 and 2013 accordingly. My focus here is to resurrect the old game while learning a thing or two about game development, I notice that big gaming companies do this too, so why not rip off some people myself and get a few bucks along the way... except, I don't have the source code of the game nor do I charge 50 bucks for a copy *(mine will be free 2 play).
				</p>
				<h3>Reversing the game</h3>
				<p>
					Before we can start developing a custom game server, we must first reverse engineer the game...

			Qpang nor MangaFighter are not owned by me. This project is not affiliated with Realfogs, OnNet or GamesCampus in any way.
